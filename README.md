## Description

We are focused on developing a cutting-edge input mechanism for typing text in Telugu. We aim towards the development of a Chrome extension/Gmail extension and/or mobile (Android/iOS) technology which is a complex combination of sophisticated artificial intelligence and natural language processing tools designed to offer users the ability to type Telugu with maximum efficiency and accuracy. The software is designed to automate the process of recognising the language and provide the user with suggested words and phrases that are most relevant to the context of the text. This approach helps to speed up the process of communication while also preventing any potential errors in the written text.  

## Brief Problem Statement

The objective of the project is to ensure ease of typing for users in languages other than English.

- The aim is to make the prepared machine learning model into a cutting-edge input mechanism for an efficient Telugu typing experience through a Chrome extension to provide sentence autocomplete functionality.
- The project also aims to maximize efficiency and accuracy while typing in different languages, enabling users to type in their own language with ease.
